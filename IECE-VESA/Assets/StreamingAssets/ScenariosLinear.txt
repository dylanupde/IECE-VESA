Question: Your mentor teacher presents you with the following information based on a recent assessment. It identifies that the following children have not mastered key letter sounds and CVC correspondence.
Letter Sound Not Mastered \t Student Name
Long e \t Hannah, Marquis, Simon, Clara 
R \t Emerson, Sofie, Nathan, and Liam
Short e \t Gia, Fatima, Marquis, Brooks, Shreya
CVC correspondence \t  Sara, Fatima, Donna, Gia 
Which of the following is the best teaching strategy for the teacher to guide the students who are struggling with their short e sound to continue developing their reading and literacy skills?
A: A whole-class activity where the teacher reads a story aloud to the group. 
Comment: This is not the best choice because it doesn’t allow for students with varying abilities to be focusing on the different levels they need. It encourages their listening skills but does not help them enhance specific reading objectives.
0
B: Small-group instruction that allows for the students to have more personalized work based off of their needs and levels. 
Comment: This is the best choice because it allows for each student to practice their reading skills at an appropriate level and it allows for more one on one time with students who may need additional help or guidance.
10
C: Individual or Partner Journaling where they can choose to work alone or with a partner to read their short story. 
Comment: This is an okay choice because it allows for some individual or partner reading to strengthen and practice their reading skills but it doesn't give guidance or structure to their reading. The teacher could walk around the room and give support as needed but they cannot be in all places at once leaving room for students to be off track or unable to get past words they may not know.

Question: You walk over to the bookshelf in your mentor teacher’s classroom to determine the book that you are going to read with your students. You pick up two books that you believe might be a possibility. The first book is “Rosie’s Walk” by Pat Hutchings. This book follows Rosie as she is chased by the fox around the farm and has directionality allowing the children to use hand motions and movements while reading. The second book is “Ten Pets the Sound of Short E” by Cynthia Amoroso.  This book helps students learn their CVC words and uses repetition to highlight how to use the short “e” sound. Knowing your students and their needs, what book do you choose?
A: Choose to use “Rosie’s walk” because it will keep the student’s interest and they will be able to be active participants in the reading. It also has a clear story line that is easier for students to follow and allows them to make predictions. This story has the potential for follow up activities and the use of props to make the reading more engaging.
Comment: This is not the best choice. Rosie’s walk may be a fun and exciting book that will keep the student’s interest, however it does not support the student's current academic needs and it is not appropriate to use in the setting of a small group guided reading lesson. Maybe try reading “Ten Pets the Sound of a Short E” with your reading group and do a full class activity with Rosie’s walk at a later time.
0
B: Choose to read “Ten Pets the sound of the Short E” because it focuses on CVC words and short vowel sounds, something that your students need additional help with.
Comment: This is a good choice but not the best. This is the best book option to choose based on the student’s overall academic needs. However, don’t discredit Rosie’s walk. It is a great option to help children with directionality, and it provides opportunities for follow up activities and the use of props to make reading more engaging. It may not be a good choice for a guided reading group, but it would be a good story to read to the full class at a different time.
5
C: Read “Ten Pets the Sound of the Short E” for your reading group to give them extra help with CVC correspondence. But set aside “Rosie’s walk” and the accompanying activities to do with the full class at a later time.
Comment: This is the best choice. “Ten Pets the sound of the Short E” is the best book option to choose for this small reading group given your student’s individual and group needs. Yet “Rosie's Walk” is a good book to read to the whole class because of its potential to get the students moving and engaged with the story.

Question: You decided your final assessment for your students was to gauge their understanding of their ability to read words with a short e sound. What is the best SMART objective to support your final assessment of the students? 
A: Students will practice comprehension and telling a story based on wordles pictures.
Comment: This is not the best choice because while this is an appropriate objective for a kindergarten student, it does not apply to the book that you are reading. “Ten Pets the Sound of a Short E” does not have a story for the children to follow and is rather an opportunity to practice words with a short e sound in the middle. 
0
B: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to understand how to read words that include a short E sound. 
Comment: This is an okay choice because it follows what the students are going to be learning in this lesson, however understanding something is a goal and not an objective. Objectives include verbs such as practice, analyze, create, and assess. y.
5
C: Students will practice reading words that include a short e sound and analyze their meaning. 
Comment: This is the best choice because it aligns with what you want to access and is a properly written SMART objective.

Question: How do you feel about the seating arrangement that the children moved to on their own? Knowing your students behavioral needs, would you want to change their seating arrangement? 
A: I am fine with how the students are seated.  They can seat themselves and I feel I will still be able to conduct my lesson with them seated in their current location. 
Comment: This is not the best choice. Some of your students have additional needs throughout the reading group process. Gia, who has an IEP, would be the most successful if she was seated next to the teacher as she may need the most assistance reading the book and staying on task. Potentially use a name tag system to guide the students to their seats before the lesson begins. 
0
B: I would like to stop and move Gia closest to me so I can provide her the support she needs following her IEP. 
Comment: This is the best choice. Gia who has an IEP for autism may need the most assistance during the reading group process. Having her seated next to the teacher will provide her with the extra attention and accommodations that she might need. 
10
C: Gia should sit next to Fatima, who is an attentive student and would be a good role model for Gia. 
Comment: This is an okay choice but not the best. Having Gia sit next to Fatima may provide her with a positive role model however, they are both struggling with the short “e” sound and Fatima does not have the capability to help support Gia’s academic needs. 
5




Question:  You know Gia in your group has an IEP for autism, and she needs certain accommodations to be successful in the classroom. What learning tools or additional accommodations should you provide to Gia to help her be successful in this lesson?
A: Gia should be provided with stuffed toys to practice reading to, a fake finger to place over her real finger to help her follow along in the book and stay on task, an exercise ball to sit on, and an audiobook that reads the story out loud to her. 
Comment: This is an okay choice as these accommodations might help Gia be successful. However, these are not the supports that are listed in her IEP and do not relate to her identified challenges. 
5
B: Gia should not be accommodated and should be moved to a special reading group. Accommodating her will be too much work, and I will not be able to focus on my other students. 
Comment: This is NOT a good choice. Under her IEP and inclusion laws, Gia is to remain in the general classroom and should be provided with the accommodations that she needs to complete the same tasks as her peers. 
0
C: Gia should be provided with sensory adaptive equipment and visual supports including a small alphabet chart, visual pictures for the vocabulary words that will be taught, and large cut out letters of the words she will be working on. 
Comment: This is the best choice because it provides Gia with the accommodations that are stated in her IEP. These accommodations will help Gia understand the concepts being taught and remain in the emotional and physical state to be able to learn.

Question: It is time to begin your lesson. How would you introduce the book and what information would you review prior to reading?
A: Each child should be allowed to read their book on their own and we will discuss it when they are done. 
Comment: This is not a good choice. Your students are young and need set direction on where to go next. Some students will not know what to do, and they will not understand the vocabulary words and objectives they are trying to learn. 
0
B: Show the children the cover of the book and have them start predicting what the story might be about. Ask prompting questions including “Why is it called Ten Pets?”, “How do you know?” to get the students thinking. Use a white board to highlight key vocabulary words such as “Pet” and “Ten” before reading and have the students practice these words on their own. 
Comment: This is the best choice. The book should be introduced to the whole group before individual reading and analysing can begin. Use prompting questions to get the students thinking about what is going to happen and what some of the vocabulary words might mean. 
10
C: Immediately start a picture walk and have the students flip through the pages on their own to identify any cues from the pictures. Use prompting questions during the picture walk to encourage their ideas and thinking. 
Comment: This is an okay choice but not the best. Your students need to be introduced to the book and the vocabulary as a whole group before going into a picture walk. 
5




Question: Sight words are important to teach your students because they do not follow all of the roles of spelling. How do you prepare your students for the sight words in this lesson before you begin reading? 
A: Have them sit down and go through the picture walk on their own, allow them to figure out the sight words and any other difficult concepts on their own. 
Comment: This is the worst choice because it never introduces the sight words. Students are not  given the chance to see if they know them and are expected to teach themselves.. Students need to be introduced to sight words and other challenging concepts that might arise so they are prepared for the reading. 
0
B: Highlight different sight words arising throughout the book and have cards with each sight word on them. Allow the students to take turns choosing a different card and having them read the word on their card and spell it aloud for the rest of the group. 
Comment: This is the best choice because it allows them to prepare for the sight words that may arise during reading and allows them to practice their knowledge of their sight words prior to reading.
10
C: Mention the idea of sight words being in the book and then during the picture walk point out some of them that you feel are more challenging.  
Comment: This is an okay choice because you review some of the sight words, preparing them for reading but you did not go over all of them, potentially causing confusion and troubles while reading the book. 
5





Question:  What types of questions do you ask students during their picture walk? 
A: Ask them questions to engage them in the story and guide their predictions, such as - “What do you think this book is about? What do you see? Have you seen any of these animals in your life? Do you have any of these pets at home? Do you see any sight words on this page? Are there any words that you don’t know or that you know very well already?”
Comment: This is the best choice because it engages all of the students, it points their attention towards the pictures they are seeing, it guides their picture walk and it draws in topics they already may know about or be excited to talk about their own pets at home. 
10
B: Ask them about the type of story they are reading such as  - “Is this book Fiction or nonfiction? Who is the main character of the story? What is the lesson of this story? What is the general story line” 
Comment: This is an okay choice because the questions are focusing on all of the students. However  these are too hard for kindergarteners and these types of questions don’t relate to the story that you will be reading with the students.  
5
C: Ask them questions about what they are seeing focusing only on the students who are talking a lot and avoid asking the entire group all of the questions.
Comment: This is the worst choice because students are left out of the learning. It does not allow those quieter or lower level students to be involved in the conversation which may lead them to zoning out or getting frustrated.

Question: Brooks lost his hamster just a few days ago and shuts down when you ask about family pets. How do you best respond to this situation?
A: Pretend not to notice Brooks and move on with the lesson hoping he will forget about his hamster and regain his focus on his own. If in a few minutes he does not stop crying try another strategy. 
Comment: This is the worst choice. Brooks is not being provided the change to acknowledge his feelings and understand what his body is doing. Moving on without saying anything teaches Brooks that he needs to suppress his emotions. 
0
B: Acknowledge Brooks by saying “Brooks, I notice that you have a sad face. Your mouth is frowning and your eyes are starting to water” When Brookslooks at you, take a deep breath and ask him what is wrong. Allow him to share about his hamster to the group if he wants and help guide him to acknowledge his own feelings and regain his focus. 
Comment: This is the best choice. You are helping Brooks acknowledge his emotions and what his body is doing and helping him calm down and return his mind to the executive state. Allowing Brooks this opportunity will teach him that his emotions are valid and will help return to a state in which he can learn. 
10
C: Acknowledge that Brooks is feeling sad and ask another student to try and help him feel better. This way you can continue on with the lesson.  If his friend is not able to help him try another strategy later on in the lesson. 
Comment: This is an okay choice. You acknowledged Brooks’ emotions however, he would benefit more from having you to work through his emotions with him instead of a peer.

Question: Shreya was talking about her new puppy and got really excited causing her to forget her inside voice.  This caused an increase in sensory information causing Gia to cover her ears and start shaking in her seat. How would you best handle this situation and to remind Shreya about her inside voice and help Gia regain her focus. 
A: Calmly approach Gia and support her as she calms down as you remind Shreya quietly to lower her voice to an inside voice.  You may have to softly touch Gia to let her know that you are helping her as you gently guide Gia to do what she needs to do.  Once everyone is calm, remind them of the lesson’s target and begin the lesson again.
Comment:  This is the best choice due to both of the girls' needs being met, the group continues their lesson with a reminder of what they were working toward before their attention was strayed from the target. 
10
B: Raise your voice and remind Shreya that she is not to use that loud of voice in the classroom as you run quickly to Gia.  Once the students are settled just begin teaching again.
Comment: This is the worst choice as you will startle both of the girls and they will panic and feel unsafe.  You may lose the whole group losing precious instructional time as you have to regain the confidence in the room.  
0
C: Calmly remind Shreya that she is using an outdoor voice and remind Gia that she is in a safe place and remain near her until she is calm. Pick up the lesson where it stopped.
Comment: This choice will work to settle the group, but this age will forget the target and will be lost and confused if you just start the lesson again without reminding them of what you want them to learn in the group.

Question: How are you going to cue students to prepare to read? 
A: Instruct students to begin reading on their own in a whisper voice by saying, “Ready Go”
Comment: This is an okay choice because it encourages the students to read on their own. However,  it gives them no instruction, support or guidance for their reading. Students who may struggle more with their reading or staying on task may struggle or lose complete focus. 
5
B: Remind the students of reading strategies to help them when they get stuck. These reading strategies could include having their mouth ready to form sounds, Eagle Eye to find picture cues, stopping to stretch sounds, and to look for the chunks they know.
Comment: This is the best choice because it gives them instruction and they should already know the strategies stated, giving them an outline for what they are doing and what they should do when they get stuck. 
10
C: Begin reading the story aloud to the students, having them follow along in the text with their finger. After a few pages have each student take a turn reading to the whole group.
Comment: This is not a good choice because reading out loud to them is more appropriate for large group activities. There is guidance and instruction here, with the following of the finger, but there is little structure or support for the students in their reading. Additionally, students may get nervous or self cautious having to read in front of others.

Question: While going around the table and the children take turns reading, you notice that Brooks is continually talking to Shreya and not doing their work. What do you do?
A: Raise your voice and immediately tell Shreya and Brooks to stop talking and focus on their book.
Comment: This is not a good choice because this harsh tone would scare the students and they are not in any physical danger. You are also making assumptions that they are talking about something completely unrelated to the book when they could be discussing their predictions or talking about the pets they have at home. 
0
B: Access the situation and determine what they are talking about and if they have finished their work. Remind them to move on to early finisher activities when they are done reading or to return to their attention and focus to their book. Remind them to use their quiet voices as not to distract the rest of the students. 
Comment: This is the best choice. You are taking the time to understand the situation fully without making assumptions and working on guiding the students to regain their focus. If what they are talking about is related to the book, you could ask them to share it with the group at the end of individual reading time. 
10
C: Encourage them to share their ideas with the whole group. This will allow them to share what they were thinking and be able to refocus on reading their individual books or moving on to the early finisher activity. 
Comment: This is not a good choice. You did not take the time to determine if what they were talking about was related to the lesson and its context. Additionally having them share the information during the middle of individual reading time will distract the other students and cause them to get off track.

Question: Marquis is wiggling in his seat, constantly standing up and down, and grabbing and playing with the book. How can you help him focus?
A: Help Marquis find movement options that will help him learn. Give him either a band on the bottom of his chair, a weighted toy to sit in his lap, a ball to sit on or assign him to help you prep for the next stage of the activity. 
Comment: This is the best choice because it provides Marquis with productive options for movement helping him to regain his focus. Additionally giving wiggly students a job to do helps them feel important and focus on a set task. 
10
B: Focus on gently reminding Marquis of the positive behavior that we use during reading. Tell Marquis that when we read we keep our body still and our mind focused and return to working with the other students.
Comment: This is not a good choice. You tried to remind him of positive behavior, however all Marquis will be able to focus on is keeping his body still and he will not be able to focus on reading. Give him appropriate options for movement if he feels the need to be moving his body. 
0
C: Sternly tell Marquis to sit back down and continue reading. 
Comment: This is not a good choice. Using a demanding or stern voice is not appropriate in this situation because Marquis is not in any physical danger and has not been constantly ignoring instructions. You should remind him of the positive behavior and provide him the support he needs to get there.

Question: Fatima keeps struggling on the word “Nest”, she is getting super frustrated and is saying things like “I do not want to read” and “This book is dumb”, what should you do?
A: Acknowledge Fatima’s signs of frustrations and get her to understand her own emotions. Help her to take a deep breath and return to her executive state. Use prompting questions to help her understand what she knows and how to use the pictures as cues. Help her work to stretch the word and focus on the short E sound.
Comment: This is the best choice. You acknowledge that Fatima is frustrated and you helped her return to a mental state in which she can learn. You gave her the support she needed to figure out the word she was stuck on and continue the story with more confidence in herself. 
10
B: Go over to Fatima and encourage her to look at the picture for a clue to what the word might be. Assist her in stretching her sounds and write the word on the white board so it is easily visible to her. 
Comment: This is an okay choice because you gave Fatima the support that she needed to figure out the word she was stuck on and she can continue to read the story. However, without helping her to recognize her feeling of frustration she won’t be in an appropriate mental state to learn anything. 
5
C: Acknowledge that Fatima is frustrated and give her a few moments to calm down and work through the problem on her own. Provide Fatima  assistance if she is still stuck after a few minutes.
Comment: This is not a good choice. You acknowledged that she was frustrated, however she needs your help to gain the self confidence she needs to figure out the word she is stuck on.

Question: What is the best activity to wrap up your guided reading group?
A: Have a student gather the books and tell the students all they did an amazing job today in their reading group and guide them to successfully transition to their next activity. 
Comment: This is the worst choice because it gives them no wrap up or self assessment after their reading, there is no conclusion or ending to your small guided reading lesson. 
0
B: Engage in a retell and a self assessment of the story. Have the students, as a whole, go through and retell or summarize what they read. Ask comprehension questions to ensure their understanding and work through any vocabulary words they still need help on. Praise them for their amazing work and have them self reflect on how they did with their reading today and share any new words they may have learned or mastered.
Comment: This is an okay choice because it allows the students to reflect on what they learned and practice any vocabulary words that they might still be struggling with. However, having the students retell the story and answer comprehension questions is not appropriate for the book that they read. “10 Pets the Sound of the Short E” does not have a storyline or any main characters or ideas. 
5
C: Review key vocabulary words with the students using a white board or cut out letters to practice. Ensure that the students can read the word and understand what it means. Some students might even be to the point where they can spell the word with cut out letters. Engage in self assessment of their learning and allow them to share any new words that they learned.
Comment: This is the best choice because it provides the students with an opportunity to review key concepts and vocabulary words to ensure their understanding. Additionally, it allows them to self reflect on what they learned or how they did in their small reading group that day. This self reflection and retell of the story is so important in younger readers to be able to explain and comprehend what they learned and be able to self reflect on the new information gained, whether it be new words or even just a better understanding of what they are reading. This also provides the teacher with an extra opportunity to assess their students and their levels.

Question: You noticed that Gia and Shreya are struggling with their sight words and identifying different letters. What do you do as their teacher, outside of the reading group, to help them better understand the sight words and letter recognition?
A: Work with the class as a large group and review the sight words covered and other additional concepts that Gia and Shreya were struggling with. This allows the students to continue building their skills without being singled out.
Comment: This is an okay answer because reviewing in a large group still gets the students who need the review more practice but it does not get the students one-on-one instruction, to get them the help them understand and walk through the sight words and letter differentiation.  
5
B: Wait and see if the students catch on next week. Take Gia and Shreya out into the hall to practice if they still don’t know them by the following week.
Comment: This is the worst answer because ignoring the issue could cause these students to fall further behind. 
0
C: Plan to work with Sherya, Gia and anyone else in the class that is struggling in an additional small group at a later time. You can create an additional guided reading lesson that goes over the sight words and work on the letters differentiation with each of the students to give them some extra practice and smaller group work time to better understand these topics.
Comment:  This is the best answer because you are giving the students individual support during the next small group time without singling them out or removing them from large group activities.They can ask questions and get that one on one time with you.
